The last trend for blogging is to use a static site generator. This has some
advantages over dynamic websites (wordpress) and online blog services (blogger):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is more easy to do than deploying a application server, as there is no
special installation/configuration needed (especially if you use GitHub for
hosting).
</li>
<li>This prevents attacks on the server as there are no interactions with dynamic
parts.
</li>
<li>The posts and associated contents can be versioned in a git repository as it
is using only text files, not databases.
</li>
<li>The content of your blog is not locked to an online blog engine, so you are
free to move <i>easily</i> whenever you want all your content to a new system.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thanks to <a href="https://spacemacs.org">Spacemacs</a>, I entered the Emacs' world recently and started to enjoy
<code>org-mode</code>. When I decided (again) to start a blog, I looked around for a static
site generation supporting this file format. The problem of <code>org-mode</code> is that
it is only fully supported within emacs, as most of its power come from all the
extensions that will probably not be supported by any parser. I looked at
different static site generators, among which only a few where supporting more
than Markdown/RestrucuredText. My choice was directed to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> which has a
support of a lot of format thanks to <code>pandoc</code>. But I was pleasantly surprised
when I read the description of the <a href="https://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode"><code>orgmode</code> plugin for Nikola</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This plugin implements an Emacs Org-mode based compiler for Nikola.
</p>

<p>
If your emacs does not ship with org-mode (&gt;=8.x), you will have to edit the
init.el file supplied with this plugin, and load a newer version of org-mode.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This meant that the plugin is using the real Emacs <code>org-mode</code> to render the
posts of the website. This finished to convinced me starting my blog using this
engine, and to write about this experience (in <code>org-mode</code> of course) as a first
post. You are reading it. In this article I will detail the installation
procedure to setup a website powered by <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> and hosted on GitHub pages.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Setting up the system</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This first part will describe how to set up the whole system, from GitHub pages
to Nikola's <code>org-mode</code> support.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">GitHub pages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
GitHub is offering a service called <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> that allows people to serve
static websites through their GitHub repositories. There is the possibility to
serve one website per repository and also to create one website linked to the
username. Thanks to this, people can own their associate their blog with their
GitHub's usernames. One restriction being that GitHub is only serving static
content, i.e. <code>.html</code> pages with some <code>javascript</code> or <code>css</code>, but this should be
far enough for running most personal blogs.
</p>

<p>
The main user website is be accessible at <code>http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/</code>. The
website will be served from the <code>master</code> branch of a repository that should be
called <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>. You can have a look at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">the GitHub's documentation</a>
for more details about this.
</p>

<p>
The first step to install the blog is to go on GitHub, and create a repository
called <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>. You can give a description if you want, but don't
check the "Initialize this repository" checkbox, nor add a <code>.gitignore</code> or a
license: we want the repository to be empty. Once the repository has been
created, you can clone it on your computer with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git clone git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git ~/blog
</pre></div>

<p>
As the <code>master</code> branch will be used for the rendered website, let us create a
branch called <code>sources</code> to put the… sources of your blog:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> ~/blog
$ git checkout -b sources
</pre></div>

<p>
You can already add a <code>.gitignore</code> to the folder:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>*.py[cod]
__pycache__
cache
output
.doit.db
_env/
</pre></div>

<p>
and commit it (be sure to be on the <code>sources</code> branch):
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m <span class="s2">"Add .gitignore"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
We should be ready to continue.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Installing Nikola</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
There are different ways of installing Nikola:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can install it from your package manager, if your distribution provides a
package for it. This is the best solution if the package exists.
</li>
<li>You can install it globally on your computer with <code>pip</code>, but this has the
tendency to "pollute" the filesystem, as it is not managed by the package
manager.
</li>
<li>You can install it within a Python virtual environment. This is the method I
will present you here.
</li>
<li>If you have your own preferred way to install it, please do so.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I choose to use a virtual environment because Archlinux is not providing an
official package for Nikola. There is an <code>AUR</code> package for it, but this implies
to build several of its dependencies from <code>AUR</code> too, and I don't went to spend
my time checking their <code>PKGBUILD</code> at each update. As I also don't like using
<code>pip</code> (or alternative tools) to install globally on my system, I decided to use
a virtual environment.
</p>

<p>
The <code>pyvenv</code> virtual environment is provided directly by the <code>python</code> package on
Archlinux, so I decided to go for it. You can of course use another virtual
environment tool if you prefer. In order to make the installation of Nikola in a
virtual environment the simplest as possible, I created a simple Makefile that
will do the most of the job.
</p>

<p>
Let us start by defining a variable for the name of the environment folder:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">ENVIRONMENT</span> <span class="o">:=</span> _env/
</pre></div>

<p>
I also added a default target as first one in the Makefile to select what should
be called when no target is specified. It is a good practice from my point of
view, as it uncouples the logic from the target ordering.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">default</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">help</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Then a target to create and clean the environment:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">$(ENVIRONMENT)</span><span class="o">:</span>
  pyvenv <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$@</span><span class="s2">"</span>

<span class="nf">clean</span><span class="o">:</span>
  rm -rf <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">$(</span>ENVIRONMENT<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
If you are not used to Makefiles, it can look a little bit complicated. As we
are using a variable, the target name is replaced by its value, same for <code>$@</code>
that is a special variable that as for value the target's name. So it translates
to:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">_env/</span><span class="o">:</span>
  pyvenv <span class="s2">"_env/"</span>

<span class="nf">clean</span><span class="o">:</span>
  nikola clean
  rm -rf <span class="s2">"_env/"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In order to use a virtual environment, one as to manually source from his
terminal the <code>$(ENVIRONMENT)/bin/activate</code> file. Once the environment has been
activated, the user need to install Nikola. To make this simpler for the user, I
have done a <code>setup</code> target printing all required commands:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">setup</span><span class="o">:</span>
  @echo <span class="s2">"make </span><span class="k">$(</span>ENVIRONMENT<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">;"</span>
  @echo <span class="s2">"source </span><span class="k">$(</span>ENVIRONMENT<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">bin/activate;"</span>
  @echo <span class="s2">"pip install --upgrade pip 'Nikola[extras]';"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
When this target is executed, it will only <b>print</b> this to the command line:
</p>

<pre class="example">
make _env/;
source _env/bin/activate;
pip install --upgrade pip 'Nikola[extras]';
</pre>

<p>
This contains all steps required to setup the system:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Call the Makefile to create the environment
</li>
<li>Source the <code>activate</code> file to enable it
</li>
<li>Use <code>pip</code> <i>within the environment</i> to upgrade <code>pip</code> and install/upgrade Nikola
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Instead of asking the user to copy/paste this in their terminal, it is possible
to evaluate it directly with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="k">$(</span>make setup<span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
This will do all the work, but let us add an <code>help</code> target that explains this
literally to the user:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">help</span><span class="o">:</span>
  @echo <span class="s2">"To setup Nikola environment, please use 'eval \$</span><span class="k">$(</span>make setup<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">'."</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
You can now initialize the environment and install Nikola with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="k">$(</span>make setup<span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
It will takes time the first call, but later ones will be much faster. Try to
call <code>nikola -h</code> to be sure everything was installed correctly. The resulting
Makefile <a href="https://github.com/StreakyCobra/StreakyCobra.github.io/blob/sources/Makefile">can be found on my GitHub repository</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Site creation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The skeleton of the website can be created with these commands. Note you will
have to give some information to create the site:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nikola init my_first_site
<span class="c1"># Fill the asked information</span>
$ mv my_first_site/* .
$ rm -r my_first_site
</pre></div>

<p>
Nikola will create the site in a sub-directory so we have to move it to our
current directory. You will see that for now there is only empty folders and a
<code>conf.py</code> file. It is a pretty long configuration file, but you have to go
through it if you want to see all possibilities to customize Nikola.
</p>

<p>
You can now commit the <code>Makefile</code> and the <code>conf.py</code> files in the <code>sources</code>
branch (if not already done):
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git add Makefile conf.py
$ git commit -m <span class="s2">"Add Makefile and conf.py"</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-2-4">org-mode support</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Here comes the interesting parts: making Nikola play with org-mode! There is an
"official" <a href="https://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode">Nikola's plugin</a> for this, so is quite simple to install:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nikola plugin -i orgmode
</pre></div>

<p>
The prerequisite being to have Emacs installed with <code>org-mode &gt; 8.x</code>.
</p>

<p>
You will also have to edit the <code>conf.py</code> file so that Nikola will recognize the
<code>org</code> files. For this, edit the file and add the following lines:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Add the orgmode compiler to your COMPILERS dict.</span>
<span class="n">COMPILERS</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"orgmode"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'.org'</span><span class="p">,)</span>

<p>
You can commit the added files:

<h3 id="sec-2-5">Testing the system</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">

<p>
And open your browser at <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a>. If you have a web page, it is

To write a new post, simply use the following command:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nikola new_post -e -f orgmode
</pre></div>

<p>
The <code>-e</code> flag tell Nikola to open the file directly for editing, and the <code>-f
orgmode</code> tell it to use the <code>org-mode</code> format. Then simply save the file and
close your editor when this has been done.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">Building the website</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">

As we already saw previously, the site can be built and tested with the
following commands:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nikola build
$ nikola serve
</pre></div>

<p>
The <code>build</code> command create the static content of the site, and the <code>serve</code>
command run a development server to see what it looks like locally. This can be
done whenever you want to see the changes. Note there is also this command that
can be used advantageously as it will detect changes and rebuild the site
automatically:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nikola auto

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3">Deploying on GitHub</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
In order to deploy on GitHub easily, only one simple step has to be done: edit
the <code>conf.py</code> file and change these variables as in this snippet:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">GITHUB_SOURCE_BRANCH</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'sources'</span>
<span class="n">GITHUB_DEPLOY_BRANCH</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'master'</span>

It is all. Now you can deploy your website on GitHub by simply calling:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nikola github_deploy

The theme of the website can be changed easily. Nikola provides some
<a href="https://themes.getnikola.com/">predefined themes</a> that you can easily use. For this use the following command:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ nikola install_theme &lt;theme_name&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
And change the following variable in the `conf.py` file:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">THEME</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;theme_name&gt;"</span>

<h3 id="sec-4-3">Code syntax coloration with org-mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
The <code>pygmentize</code> tool is needed in order to have syntactic coloration with
<code>org-mode</code>. It should have been installed within the virtual environment
already, so no step <i>should</i> be needed.
</p>

<p>
You need to generate a custom <code>css</code> file in order to make the coloration being
displayed on the <code>html</code> page. For this run the following commands:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ mkdir -p files/assets/css/
$ pygmentize -S friendly -a .highlight -f html &gt;&gt; files/assets/css/custom.css

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
It was a really interesting work to setup this project. <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> is a simple and
nice static site generator, and it is plugin for working with <code>org-mode</code> is the
better that I have seen.
</p>

<p>
I should mention that I have not tested the <code>org-mode</code> really far, so there may
be some surprises. For now the only problem that I have seen is the inner links:
I did not find a way to make it work for inserting a table of contents. Also,
including images work, but for an unknown reason I have to set links to one
level above, i.e. <code>../../images/logo.png</code> instead of <code>../images/logo.png</code>. All
this are relatively minor problems, and having a tool offering <code>org-mode</code>,
Markdown, RestructuredText, and many other format is a nice to have.
